The formation of the Sierpinski triangle begins with a single filled triangle. With each iteration, the area of 
each remaining filled triangle is reduced by 1/4 as the middle interior equilateral triangle is removed. We observe 
that there are 3^n filled triangles on the nth iteration, each with 1/4 the area of the filled triangles of the 
previous iteration. Thus the limit of the Sierpinski triangle's area is zero.

<li><a href="sChaos.html">Chaos Game<span id="info2">
The Chaos game gives a method for generating arbitrarily close approximations to the Sierpinski triangle. It can
be described with the following algorithm:
<br><br>
1 Begin with three vertices and randomly choose a point X inside the triangle they form. 
<br><br>
2 Randomly choose one of the three vertices and draw an imaginary line between X and our random vertex.
<br><br>
3 Plot a dot on the midpoint Y of this line. 
<br> <br>
4 Let X=Y and go to step 2. Repeat an arbitrarily large number of times.

<li><a href="sCurve.html">Sierpinski Curve<span id="info3">
The Sierpinski arrowhead curve is a base-motif fractal identical to the Sierpinski triangle for arbitrarily
large numbers of iterations. Notice that the length of the one-dimensional curve that forms this fractal is 
increased by a factor of 3/2 with each iteration. Thus, although it is identical in area and Hausdorff dimension
to the Sierpinski triangle, the limit of the length of the

 <div class="mainInfo">
	<p>The Sierpinski triangle-- also called the Sierpinski gasket or Sierpinski sieve-- is a self-similar
	 fractal appearing 
	in 13th century Italian art with its formal description attributed to Polish mathematician Waclaw Sierpinski 
	in 1915. Its <a  class="linkEmbed" href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_dimension" target="_blank">Hausdorff 
	dimension</a> is log(3)/log(2)~1.5848 and its area is zero. In this page, we use interactive animations to examine 
	the Sierpinski triangle, a stochastic 
	method for generating arbitrarily close approximations to it, and an identical fractal
	built with a one-dimensional curve.</p>
